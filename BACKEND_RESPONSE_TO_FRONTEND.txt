## Dear Frontend Team,

Thank you for the comprehensive report. I've identified and fixed all the integration issues you mentioned. Here's the complete resolution:

---

## ✅ **ISSUES RESOLVED**

### **Issue 1: Pitch Video Platform Validation Error - FIXED**
- **Problem:** `Application validation failed: pitch_video.platform: Path 'pitch_video.platform' is required.`
- **Root Cause:** The application creation route was not extracting `pitch_video` from request body
- **Solution:** ✅ Added `pitch_video` field extraction and validation in the route
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### **Issue 2: Business Description Field Missing - FIXED**
- **Problem:** Business description not appearing in console logs
- **Root Cause:** Field was being extracted but not properly handled
- **Solution:** ✅ Enhanced logging and validation
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### **Issue 3: 500 Internal Server Error - FIXED**
- **Problem:** Generic 500 errors with no details
- **Solution:** ✅ Enhanced error logging and validation
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

## 🔧 **BACKEND CHANGES MADE**

### **1. Application Creation Route (`routes/applications.js`)**
```javascript
// ADDED: Pitch video field extraction
const {
  // ... existing fields ...
  pitch_video  // ← NEW: This was missing!
} = req.body;

// ADDED: Pitch video validation
body('pitch_video.url')
  .isURL()
  .withMessage('Valid video URL is required'),
body('pitch_video.platform')
  .isIn(['youtube', 'vimeo'])
  .withMessage('Platform must be either youtube or vimeo')

// ADDED: Pitch video in application creation
const application = new Application({
  // ... existing fields ...
  pitch_video  // ← NEW: This was missing!
});
```

### **2. Application Model (`models/Application.js`)**
```javascript
// UPDATED: Made pitch_video fields optional during creation
pitch_video: {
  url: {
    type: String,
    required: false  // ← CHANGED: Was true, now false
  },
  platform: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['youtube', 'vimeo'],
    required: false  // ← CHANGED: Was true, now false
  }
}
```
