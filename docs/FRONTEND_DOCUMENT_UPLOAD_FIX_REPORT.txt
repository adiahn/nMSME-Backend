## Dear Frontend Team,

I've identified and fixed the missing document upload endpoints that were causing the 500 Internal Server Error. Here's the complete resolution:

---

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED**

### **Problem Identified:**
- **500 Internal Server Error** for `POST /api/documents/upload/undefined`
- **Root Cause:** Missing document upload route in the backend
- **Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

### **What Was Wrong:**
The frontend was trying to call `POST /api/documents/upload/:applicationId` but this route **didn't exist** in the backend. Only the video link upload route was available.

---

## 🔧 **BACKEND FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Added Missing Document Upload Route**
```javascript
// NEW: Document upload endpoint
POST /api/documents/upload/:applicationId
```

### **2. Added Cloudinary Integration**
- ✅ File upload to Cloudinary
- ✅ Support for multiple file types (JPEG, PNG, PDF, DOC, DOCX)
- ✅ File size limit: 10MB per file
- ✅ Up to 5 files per upload

### **3. Added Document Management Routes**
- ✅ `POST /api/documents/upload/:applicationId` - Upload documents
- ✅ `DELETE /api/documents/:documentId` - Delete individual documents
- ✅ `GET /api/documents/:applicationId` - Get all documents for an application

---

## 🎯 **NEW API ENDPOINTS**

### **✅ POST /api/documents/upload/:applicationId**
**Purpose:** Upload documents (CAC certificates, product photos, etc.)

**Request:**
```javascript
// Multipart form data
{
  documents: [File1, File2, ...], // Up to 5 files
  document_type: 'cac_certificate' | 'tax_identification' | 'product_photos' | 'business_plan' | 'financial_statements' | 'other'
}
```

**Response:**
```javascript
{
  "success": true,

    "uploaded_documents": [
      {
        "_id": "64f8a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0",

        "size": 1024000,
        "mime_type": "application/pdf",
        "uploaded_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
      }
    ],
    "total_documents": 3
  }
}
```

### **✅ DELETE /api/documents/:documentId**
**Purpose:** Delete individual documents

**Response:**
```javascript
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Document deleted successfully"
}
```

### **✅ GET /api/documents/:applicationId**
**Purpose:** Get all documents for an application

**Response:**

## 🚀 **FRONTEND INTEGRATION**

### **✅ Expected Frontend Behavior:**
1. **Application creation** should work (already working)
2. **Document upload** should now work without 500 errors
3. **File upload** should support multiple files
4. **Progress tracking** should show upload status

### **✅ Frontend API Calls Should Work:**
```javascript
// Document upload example
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('document_type', 'cac_certificate');
formData.append('documents', file1);
formData.append('documents', file2);

fetch(`http://localhost:5000/api/documents/upload/${applicationId}`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  },
  body: formData
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  console.log('Documents uploaded:', data);
});
```

---

## 🔍 **ERROR HANDLING**

### **✅ Common Error Responses:**
```javascript
// File too large
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "File too large"
}

// Invalid file type
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Invalid file type. Only JPEG, PNG, PDF, DOC, and DOCX files are allowed."
}

// No files uploaded
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "No files uploaded"
}

// Invalid document type
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Valid document type is required"
}
```

---

## 🎯 **TESTING INSTRUCTIONS**

### **1. Test Document Upload:**
```bash
# Using curl (example)
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "document_type=cac_certificate" \
  -F "documents=@/path/to/file.pdf" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/documents/upload/APPLICATION_ID
```

### **2. Frontend Testing:**
1. **Create an application** (should work)
2. **Upload documents** (should now work)
3. **Check file upload progress**
4. **Verify documents appear** in the application
